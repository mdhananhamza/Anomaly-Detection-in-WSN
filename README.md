Key Features:
Machine Learning Models: Implemented and fine-tuned models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees to detect intrusion types, including:
Flooding
Fuzzy
Malfunction

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and label-encoded CAN data fields (e.g., Unique Identifiers, Timestamps, Payload).
Applied categorical mapping and time-based feature extraction for enhanced feature engineering.
Performance Improvements:
Achieved a 25% increase in detection accuracy.
Reduced false positives by 30%, ensuring reliable threat detection.

Outcomes:
Strengthened vehicle security by effectively detecting real threats in the CAN network.
Provided a scalable and efficient solution for anomaly detection in modern WSNs.
Comprehensive documentation of methodology, experimental setup, and findings for further research and development.

This repository includes the code, data processing pipeline, and evaluation metrics to reproduce the anomaly detection system. Explore the project to learn how machine learning enhances vehicular network security!
