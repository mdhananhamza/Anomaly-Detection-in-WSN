# Anomaly-Detection-in-WSN
Anomaly detection is a key challenge in order to ensure the security and prevent malicious 
attacks in wireless sensor networks. Various machine learning techniques have been used by 
researchers these days to detect anomalies using machine learning algorithms. On the other hand,
online learning classifiers have not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. So the aim is to 
provide an intrusion detection model compatible with the characteristics of WSN. This model is 
built based on information gain ratio and Random Forest classifier. Firstly, the information gain 
ratio is used to select the relevant features of the sensor data. Secondly, the Random Forest
algorithm is trained to detect and classify different type of Deny of Service attacks.
